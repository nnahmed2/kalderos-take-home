## More about the tech stack

Redux: I remember Nate mentioning Kalderos uses Redux so I thought it would be fun to learn to use for a centralized store in this project! I used it to store the comprehensive list of all pokemon.
Material UI: I leveraged this library for all the UI components (https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)
